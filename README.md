## Objective
- Model the price of house with the available independent variables
- Model shall be used by managament to understand how prices vary with the variable.
- Management can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on the areas which yields high returns.
- Model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

## Data_Exploration
-  Variables
    -   The dataset "train.csv" has 80 features with 1460 records for predicting "SalePrice" of an Australian house. 
    -   "SalePrice" is our target variable for which the regression model needs to be built
    -   On going through the data it is found that some of the variables such as "Alley, PoolQC, Fence, MiscFeatures" are having most of the values as NAN. Hence can be dropped. 
    -   Variables such as "YearBuilt, YearRemodAdd, GarageYrBuilt" are transformed to respective ages from time of sale using formulas such as  "YrSold-YrBuilt, YrSold-YearRemodAdd, YrSold-GarageYrBuilt" resp. and the year variables are dropped. 
    -   Unimportant variables such as "ID" are also dropped
-  Zones
    -   On going through the data_description and data we can understand that the houses are majorly categorized according to zones. 
    -   "MSZoning" variable contains the zones of each house as "RL, RM, RH, FV, C(all)". 
    -   The distribution of the house sold reveals that almost "79% of house sold are from "RL" Zone, followed by "15%" in "RM" Zone and 4% in "FV"zone and minor % in RH and C(all) zones.

-  Zones   
    -   "instant", "dteday" shall be dropped due to low relavance to the model 
    -   "casual", "registered", "weekday" shall be dropped due to presence of alternate variable "cnt", "workingday", "holiday"
    -   dummy variables for "weathersit" feature shall be created with drop first method
    -   dummy variables for "season" feature shall be created with drop first method
- Correlations and Outliers
    -   Correlations, Outliers and Multicollinearities can be understood from pair plots,Box plot and heat maps
    -   PairPlot of Continuous Variables:
*![Book logo](/PP_BS_YR.png)
        -   From the above pair plot we can see a good relation between "cnt" & "temp"/"atemp"
        -   Also the "temp" and "atemp" are highly correalated and dropping one of them would prevent multicollinearity in the model.
    -   Box plot of different features:

        -   From the above box plots we can see that in year 2019 the shared bikes demand was comparetively higher than the year 2018 in all the trends.
        -   But the pattersn followed by various features such as "seasons", "weathersit", "holiday", "workingday", "mnth" in affecting the "cnt" target variable seems to be similar
        -   Also the Outliers in "cnt", "atemp", "windspeed", "hum" were identified and removed


## Multicolinearity
- To understand the multicollinearity amoung the different features, we shall plot the heat map between the variables, as well as use the variance_inflation_factor from statsmodels

    *![Book logo](/heatmap1.PNG)
    
- From the heatmap we can see that "temp" & "atemp" are highly correlated features. "temp" feature shall be dropped
- Similarly "hum", "fall" were also correlated with "atemp", which were confirmed by VIF function and elimiated one by one.

## Model_Estimate
- From the correlation matrix and other plots plotted above, we can clearly see that in the year 2019 the demand was comparitively higher than year 2018.
- But the factor(feature) which caused the increase in demand in year 2019 compared to year 2018 is perhaps not captured in the available features.
- In the correlation matrix the gains between the "cnt" and different features are not the same for year 2019 and year 2018, which confirms some unknown factor.
- For estimating the linear regression model and to get better correlation, the data needs to be split for year 2018 and 2019 and proceed with model building.
    - Linear regression models for year 2018 and 2019 were estimated separately as follows
        -   OLS models for year 2018 and year 2019 were estimated separately
        -   To identify and remove possible multicollinearities amoung features P-factor, VIF, RFE were looked into. 
        -   The model estimate were repeated for 4 runs and in each run a collinear feature with high P/VIF/RFE is removed to get the final model
        -   The final model estimate is shown below

## Conclusion
   -   From the above models and prediction we can see that 
        - "cnt" target variable can be predicted with
            -   "atemp", "summer", "winter" & "mist"
            -   "atemp" had the maximum positive influence and correlation on the shared bike demand
            -   "summer" & "winter" had minimal positive influence on bike demand
            -   "mist" had minimal negative influence on bike demand
        - For the year 2018 
            -   Model prediction are better with R2 value for train and test @ 0.761 and 0.77
        - For the year 2019
            -   Model predictions are good with R2 value for train and test @ 0.667 and 0.55, but not as good as year 2018
            -   Some unknown factor had an effect in increasing the demand because of which the R2 value had decreased
